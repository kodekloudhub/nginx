# When OS starts the nginx, it has root priveges.  It has to if it
# is going to listen to a TCP port less 1024, including 80 for HTTP
# and 443 for HTTPS.  Back in the days when a computer was pricy and
# only highly trained sysadmins ran them, this limitation made sense.
# Today, any smart aleck kid from Elbonia and a raspberry pi can be
# a sysadmin so limitation is no longer useful but we're stuck with
# it so nginx starts as root and then does a setuid system service
# call to become the user specified in the user directive
